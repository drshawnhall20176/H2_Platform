# ---------- Today's Schedule ----------

# IS its own schedule) is deliberately hidden here rather than shown broken/empty, same "hidden,
# not shown broken" posture the sidebar itself already uses for sport-gated pages. NCAAMB renders
# through the SAME rich board as every other sport here now (added directly on request to League
# Schedules, and this page gets it for free too, same shared schedule_board.py) -- honestly
# grouped into an "Other" section rather than real conferences, since no verified 350+-team
# conference table exists yet, see schedule_board.py's own module docstring for the full reasoning.
