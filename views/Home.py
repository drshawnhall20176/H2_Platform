    """
This dashboard is built on a single shared backend (`mlb_engine.py`) so every page
pulls the same live data and stays consistent.

**Pages**
- **🎯 Pitching Lab** — probable starters across today's slate, ERA vs FIP regression,
  and auto-generated discussion hooks.
- **💣 Dinger Engine** — every projected hitter on the slate with platoon edges, ISO/OPS,
  and matchup leaderboards. Uses posted lineups when available, active rosters otherwise.

Select a page from the sidebar to begin. Pick a date, and the engine fetches the slate
concurrently — a full day usually loads in a few seconds.
