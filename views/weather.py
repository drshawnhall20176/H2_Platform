"""
weather.py — game-time weather and its effect on home runs.
 
Two effects are physics, not hunches:
  • Temperature: warm air is less dense, the ball carries farther. ~robust, safe to apply.
  • Wind: the component blowing out to center field adds carry; blowing in kills it.
 
Plus dome handling: under a fixed roof, weather is irrelevant (factor 1.0).
 
ARCHITECTURE: Open-Meteo is free and keyless. Fetches are cached per (venue, hour). If a
park isn't in the table or the fetch fails, weather degrades to "n/a" (factor 1.0) and the
projection is simply un-adjusted — nothing breaks.
 
HONESTY NOTE: temperature and dome are trustworthy. The WIND effect needs each park's
orientation (the compass bearing from home plate to center field). Those bearings below are
best-effort and should be verified against a real source before you lean on the wind number;
the coefficient is deliberately conservative and the whole factor is clamped so an error
can't blow up a projection. venue_ids should also be verified against a live slate.
