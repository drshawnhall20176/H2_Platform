"""
refresh_stadiums.py — build an authoritative stadium table from MLB's own API.

Solves the verification problem: venue ids, current names, and coordinates come straight
from MLB (so this auto-handles sponsor renames and relocations, e.g. a team playing in a
temporary park). The two fields MLB's API does NOT provide — roof type and the home-plate-
to-center-field bearing for wind — are taken from weather._STATIC_STADIUMS, matched by name.

Writes data/stadiums.json, which weather.py loads and uses to override its static defaults.

    python refresh_stadiums.py            # current season
